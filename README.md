Semestral project from programming in Android: TTS Notifier

TTS Notifier does pretty much what the app name says it does. It reads out your notifications for you so you don't have to read them yourself and it comes with some more features like caller name announcement, message reading, battery state announcement, location proximity announcement. It comes with lot of customisation options.

FEATURES:
- Widget to suspend TTSN
- Customizable TTS message
- Limit length of spoken message
- Replace text to be spoken
- Ignore specific apps or notifications containing defined text
- Choice of TTS audio stream
- Choice of speaking when screen or headset is on or off, or while in silent/vibrate mode
(Note: Due to API limitations, a headset that is connected when the TTSN service starts will need to be reconnected for TTSN to see the current state; also all Bluetooth devices are detected the same, headset or not)
- Quiet Time
- Shake-to-silence
- Custom delay of TTS after notification
- Repeat notifications at custom interval while screen off
- Notification log
- Post a test notification
- TTS Notifier can only read your notifications if your device Text-to-Speech support the notifications text language.
- You can either use the default Text-To-Speech (TTS) engine, already built-in your mobile phone or any other TTS engine you find and download from the Google play store.
